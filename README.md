# GitHub REST API Access and Data Visualisation
This repository holds the code for accessing the GitHub REST API and retrieving some user and organisation repository data (GitHub_REST_API_Access.R) and also the code for creating various plots for visualisation of the data gathered. The interactive graphs (Bubble Plot, Dygraph) are in html format while the Animated Graphs (Barplot and Line Plot) are gifs. There are also still picture versions, all of which are available in the Visualisations folder, and links to view the interactive graphs on plotly etc are available. The Data_CSV_Format folder stores all the data used in CSV format. I used R and the Plotly Package to analyse GitHub Users' data, and also my work documented on GitHub throughout the months of October and December 2020.

Below are the visualisations of various data and [This is the link to my Plotly Account](https://chart-studio.plotly.com/~jina101)
